# Simple-ToDo
This is a simple to-do list built using Tkinter.
The entirety of this project was coded authentically, without the use of AI. While this is an extremely basic project, it—along with the ones that will follow—serves a larger purpose: rebuilding critical thinking skills rather than relying on having all the answers immediately available.

Some upcoming projects may involve Machine Learning or even Computer Vision, but the goal remains the same: completing everything without a single line of code written by AI. (Note: this text was grammatically refined by AI, so this is not meant as criticism or a promotion against using AI.)
